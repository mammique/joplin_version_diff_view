Fore some reasons sometimes Joplin overwrites new changes with previous version (smartphone v.s. PC concurent mismatch I assume). We can view previous version in Joplin desktop, but no highlighting nor diff comparison.

This script helps to view all recorded version history, with diffs and colors.

Type `./joplin_version_diff_view.py NOTE_ID` in the Joplin directory.
